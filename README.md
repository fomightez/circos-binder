Circos is a software package for visualizing data and information that was created by Martin Krzywinski. 

This repository enables running Circos software in a Jupyter envrioment served to a broswer via the Binder system deployed at [MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org/). 

Launch the Binder by clicking the `Launch Binder` badge above, or click [here](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/fomightez/circos-binderized/master?filepath=index.ipynb), and follow the steps to run Circos Circos is a software package for visualizing data and information.
