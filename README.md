Circos is a software package for visualizing data and information that was created by Martin Krzywinski. 

This repository enables running Circos software in a Jupyter notebook envrionment served to your broswer via the Binder system deployed at [MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org/). 

Launch and run the notebooks via Binder by clicking any [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fomightez/circos-binder/master?filepath=index.ipynb) badge anywhere on this page. An active notebook session will be spun up just for you in a process that generally only takes a few seconds. Subsequently, you can follow the steps detailed in the active notebooks to run Circos.
