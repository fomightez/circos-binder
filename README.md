Circos is a software package for visualizing data and information that was created by Martin Krzywinski. 

This repository enables running Circos software in a Jupyter notebook envrionment served to your broswer via the Binder system deployed at [MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org/). 

Launch and run the notebooks via Binder by clicking the `Launch Binder` badge above, or click [here](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/fomightez/circos-binderized/master?filepath=index.ipynb). An active notebook session will be spun up just for you in a process that generally only takes a few seconds. Subsequently, you can follow the steps detailed in the active notebooks to run Circos.

This repository was set up to take advantage of the Binder system to offer a resource to run [Martin Krzywinski's Circos software](http://circos.ca/) without the user needing to download, install, or maintain any software. See [here](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for documentation about Binder as deployed at [MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org/).
