    "This is rather technical, but I am explaining the situation here for those curious about the differences in running Circos within these set of active notebooks served via the Binder system as opposed to the command line, and those that might notice a slight difference between this notebook and subsequent ones. It boils down to the fact that in other notebooks in this series of notebooks, you'll need `%%bash` at the start of cells where you are placing code to run Circos. If you want to understand why, continue on to the next paragraph.  \n",
    "You'll note that nothing was required in each cell, but the commands you'd normally use on the command line to run Circos. This first notebook page in the series accesses the command line directly. This can be determined by looking in the upper right corner, below, the `Logout` button, and seeing there is `Bash` indicating this notebook page is actually being run in a `Bash` kernel, i.e., it is providing the computational engine enabling running code in the cells. In subsequent notebooks, however, a `%%bash` tag is included at the start of most lines of code in order to trigger that redirect while taking advantage of the richer environment revealed by running the notebooks within the interactive Python kernel. This notebook being in the `Bash` kernel was done for two reasons: (1) this made it possible for the initial commands presented to look familiar to those in the Circos documentation without the need to first introduce additional cruft, i.e., IPython magicks; and (2) since this will be the first notebook in the series of notebooks I wanted to provide the fastest, least cluttered route for those already using command line-based Circos to get back to running Circos after launching a session via Binder."
