This utility tool is useful in\\nanalyzing survey data, relationship between multiple choice answers, and\\nany data in which a record is associated with two or more partitioned\\nvalues (partitions can be categories, codes, or intervals).\\n\\n### sample data set\\n\\nFor the example data set, I have randomly generated a putative survey\\nresponses of 1000 individuals that asked questions about sex, hair\\ncolor, eye color and height. Each record corresponds to a respondent\\\\'s\\nanswers.\\n\\n    0       female  f       red     3       green   2       165\\n    1       female  f       blonde  0       blue    1       156\\n    2       female  f       brown   1       grey    3       157\\n    3       male    m       brown   1       green   2       165\\n    4       female  f       black   2       blue    1       164\\n    5       female  f       brown   1       green   2       158\\n    ...\\n    996     male    m       red     3       grey    3       179\\n    997     female  f       red     3       green   2       163\\n    998     female  f       black   2       brown   0       161\\n    999     female  f       brown   1       brown   0       160\\n\\nEach responses is given in full (e.g. green) as well as a code. The\\ncodes for hair are blonde=0, brown=1, black=2 and red=3. The codes for\\neyes are brown=0, blue=1, green=2 and grey=3. Height is in centimeters.\\n\\nThe data were geneated using a probability model in which used the\\nfrequency of hair color in the population and the probabilistic\\nrelationship between hair and eye color. This is a primitive model with\\nmanufactured parameters, but serves to illustrate the benefits of Circos\\nvisualizations of categorical data.\\n\\n### hair and eye color\\n\\nThe first sample configuration file, etc/parse-category.conf, generates\\nan image that compares hair and eye color. The start of the links are\\ndefined by column 4 (0-index). This is the column that contains the hair\\ncode (0-3). The color parameter defines the color of the segments from\\nwhich the links will start.\\n\\n    <link_start>\\n    id  = hair\\n    col = 4\\n    min = 0\\n    max = 3\\n    rx  = \\\\d\\n    color = orange\\n    </link_start>\\n\\nLink ends are defined by the eye color code, found in column 6. Eye\\ncolor segments will be green.\\n\\n    <link_start>\\n    id  = eye\\n    col = 6\\n    min = 0\\n    max = 3\\n    rx  = \\\\d\\n    color = green\\n    </link_start>\\n\\nOnce the categories for the start and end of the links are defined, the\\ndata file is parsed and turned into a format that Circos can use. One\\nset of segments will correspond to hair color, with a segment for each\\ndistinct hair color code (value found in column 4). Another set of\\nsegments will correspond to eye color. Links between them will encode\\nthe number of records with a given hair/eye color combination.\\n\\nIn the first example image, the color of the links is determined by the\\nvalue in column 2, which contains either \\\\\\\"m\\\\\\\" (male) or \\\\\\\"f\\\\\\\" (female).\\nThe values block defines the link format values for each value in this\\ncolumn.\\n\\n    <link_coding sex>\\n    order = 2\\n    use   = yes\\n    col   = 2\\n    <values>\\n    m = color=black_a4\\n    f = color=black_a8\\n    </values>\\n    </link_coding>\\n\\nYou can add more coding blocks, which are evaluated in order of the\\nvalue of the order parameter. For example,\\n\\n    <link_coding height>\\n    order = 1\\n    use   = yes\\n    col   = 7\\n    <values>\\n    158 = stroke_color=green,stroke_thickness=3p\\n    159 = stroke_color=green,stroke_thickness=3p\\n    160 = stroke_color=green,stroke_thickness=3p\\n    161 = stroke_color=green,stroke_thickness=3p\\n    162 = stroke_color=green,stroke_thickness=3p\\n    168 = stroke_color=red,stroke_thickness=3p\\n    169 = stroke_color=red,stroke_thickness=3p\\n    170 = stroke_color=red,stroke_thickness=3p\\n    171 = stroke_color=red,stroke_thickness=3p\\n    172 = stroke_color=red,stroke_thickness=3p\\n    </values>\\n    </link_coding>\\n\\nThe rules for link formatting are simple: (1) rules triggered later\\n(based on order parameter) overwrite any formatting set by previous\\nrules, and (2) records with the same formatting form independent\\nribbons. The consequence of (2) is that you can subdivide a group of\\nrecords for a given start/end category value (e.g. blonde hair/blue eye)\\ninto smaller groups based on other values (e.g. blonde/blue males and\\nfemales, or blonde/blue males 170cm and blonde/blue females 160cm).\\n\\n### ribbon order\\n\\nThe order of the start and end of the ribbons on each segment is\\ncontrolled by the \\\\<link\\\\_order\\\\> blocks. The following ways of ordering\\nribbons are supported\\n\\n-   by size - ribbons are placed in decreasing order of thickness\\n    (number of records)\\n-   by coding - ribbons are placed in alphanumeric order of the code\\n    used to determine their format characteristics through the\\n    \\\\<link\\\\_coding\\\\> blocks\\n-   by other end - ribbons are placed to limit the number of crossing\\n    ribbons, and this order scheme can only be used for one of the two\\n    ends\\n-   by radius - ribbons are placed in increasing order of the radius of\\n    their end\\n\\nRibbon order is defined in the \\\\<link\\\\_order\\\\> block and specified for\\nthe start and end of the ribbon. For example,\\n\\n    <link_order>\\n    start = otherend\\n    end   = size\\n    </link_order>\\n\\n### ribbon radius\\n\\nThe radial position of a ribbon can be adjusted based on any column\\nvalue. This is done using \\\\<radius\\\\> blocks within the \\\\<link\\\\_start\\\\>\\nand \\\\<link\\\\_end\\\\> blocks. The radius of the ribbon is mapped onto radius\\nmin-max range (rmin-rmax) based on the value of a column (possibly\\nremapped) and a range of acceptable values (min-max).\\n\\nFor example, the block\\n\\n    <link_start>\\n    ...\\n    <radius>\\n    use   = yes\\n    col   = 7\\n    remap = int((190-int(x))/5)\\n    min   = 0\\n    max   = 10\\n    rmin  = 0.7\\n    rmax  = 0.98\\n    </radius>\\n    </link_start>\\n\\nwill place the start of the ribbon at a radius proportional to a\\nremapped height value. The height value is sampled from column 7 and\\nremapped according to the remap parameter. The effect of the remap\\nparameter as shown here is to map the height values, which range\\n144-189, to a range 0-9.\\n\\nJust like for formatting, radial values are used to split the record\\nset. If you have a large number of possible radial values, you will wind\\nup with a large number of thin ribbons, since it\\\\'s likely that no more\\nthan a few records will have the same radial value. It is therefore a\\ngood idea to bin adjacent radial values together to reduce the number of\\nribbons and avoid having a busy, uninterpretable figure.\\n\\n\"\n",

Visualizing Categorical Data](????????????)\n\n\n\nThat page is found as part number 4 of the ??? part ['Helper Tools' section](http://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/quick_start/) of [the larger set of Circos tutorials](http://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/).\n\n\n\nGo back to Part 6 by clicking [here &#8592;](HelperTools_Part6.ipynb).\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n9 --- Helper Tools\n==================\n\n7. Visualizing Categorical Data\n-------------------------------\n\n::: {#menu4}\n[[Lesson](/documentation/tutorials/utilities/categorical_data/lesson){.clean}]{.active}\n[Images](/documentation/tutorials/utilities/categorical_data/images){.normal}\n:::\n\nscript location\n---------------\n\n    tools/categoryviewer\n\nscript usage\n------------\n\n    > cd tools/categoryviewer\n    # use canned data\n    > ./makeimage\n    # which runs\n    > cat data/individuals.txt | bin/parse-category -conf etc/parse-category.conf > data/links.txt 2> data/karyotype.txt\n    > ../../bin/circos -conf etc/circos.conf\n\nThe input data must be tab delimited. The individuals.txt file is an\nexample of a randomly generated set of eye color, hair color, height and\nsex of 1000 individuals.\n\nThe output of parse-category is the link file, sent to STDOUT (redirect\nwith \\>), and the karyotype file, sent to STDERR (redirect with 2\\>).\n\ndetails\n-------\n\nThis utility tool is similar to the table viewer ([Tutorial\n9.5](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos/?tutorials&id=9&section=5)\ntools/tableviewer), but instead of tabular data (stored as a matrix of\nrows and columns), this tool generates images of categorical data which\nis supplied as one record per line. This utility tool is useful in\nanalyzing survey data, relationship between multiple choice answers, and\nany data in which a record is associated with two or more partitioned\nvalues (partitions can be categories, codes, or intervals).\n\n### sample data set\n\nFor the example data set, I have randomly generated a putative survey\nresponses of 1000 individuals that asked questions about sex, hair\ncolor, eye color and height. Each record corresponds to a respondent\\'s\nanswers.\n\n    0       female  f       red     3       green   2       165\n    1       female  f       blonde  0       blue    1       156\n    2       female  f       brown   1       grey    3       157\n    3       male    m       brown   1       green   2       165\n    4       female  f       black   2       blue    1       164\n    5       female  f       brown   1       green   2       158\n    ...\n    996     male    m       red     3       grey    3       179\n    997     female  f       red     3       green   2       163\n    998     female  f       black   2       brown   0       161\n    999     female  f       brown   1       brown   0       160\n\nEach responses is given in full (e.g. green) as well as a code. The\ncodes for hair are blonde=0, brown=1, black=2 and red=3. The codes for\neyes are brown=0, blue=1, green=2 and grey=3. Height is in centimeters.\n\nThe data were geneated using a probability model in which used the\nfrequency of hair color in the population and the probabilistic\nrelationship between hair and eye color. This is a primitive model with\nmanufactured parameters, but serves to illustrate the benefits of Circos\nvisualizations of categorical data.\n\n### hair and eye color\n\nThe first sample configuration file, etc/parse-category.conf, generates\nan image that compares hair and eye color. The start of the links are\ndefined by column 4 (0-index). This is the column that contains the hair\ncode (0-3). The color parameter defines the color of the segments from\nwhich the links will start.\n\n    <link_start>\n    id  = hair\n    col = 4\n    min = 0\n    max = 3\n    rx  = \\d\n    color = orange\n    </link_start>\n\nLink ends are defined by the eye color code, found in column 6. Eye\ncolor segments will be green.\n\n    <link_start>\n    id  = eye\n    col = 6\n    min = 0\n    max = 3\n    rx  = \\d\n    color = green\n    </link_start>\n\nOnce the categories for the start and end of the links are defined, the\ndata file is parsed and turned into a format that Circos can use. One\nset of segments will correspond to hair color, with a segment for each\ndistinct hair color code (value found in column 4). Another set of\nsegments will correspond to eye color. Links between them will encode\nthe number of records with a given hair/eye color combination.\n\nIn the first example image, the color of the links is determined by the\nvalue in column 2, which contains either \\\"m\\\" (male) or \\\"f\\\" (female).\nThe values block defines the link format values for each value in this\ncolumn.\n\n    <link_coding sex>\n    order = 2\n    use   = yes\n    col   = 2\n    <values>\n    m = color=black_a4\n    f = color=black_a8\n    </values>\n    </link_coding>\n\nYou can add more coding blocks, which are evaluated in order of the\nvalue of the order parameter. For example,\n\n    <link_coding height>\n    order = 1\n    use   = yes\n    col   = 7\n    <values>\n    158 = stroke_color=green,stroke_thickness=3p\n    159 = stroke_color=green,stroke_thickness=3p\n    160 = stroke_color=green,stroke_thickness=3p\n    161 = stroke_color=green,stroke_thickness=3p\n    162 = stroke_color=green,stroke_thickness=3p\n    168 = stroke_color=red,stroke_thickness=3p\n    169 = stroke_color=red,stroke_thickness=3p\n    170 = stroke_color=red,stroke_thickness=3p\n    171 = stroke_color=red,stroke_thickness=3p\n    172 = stroke_color=red,stroke_thickness=3p\n    </values>\n    </link_coding>\n\nThe rules for link formatting are simple: (1) rules triggered later\n(based on order parameter) overwrite any formatting set by previous\nrules, and (2) records with the same formatting form independent\nribbons. The consequence of (2) is that you can subdivide a group of\nrecords for a given start/end category value (e.g. blonde hair/blue eye)\ninto smaller groups based on other values (e.g. blonde/blue males and\nfemales, or blonde/blue males 170cm and blonde/blue females 160cm).\n\n### ribbon order\n\nThe order of the start and end of the ribbons on each segment is\ncontrolled by the \\<link\\_order\\> blocks. The following ways of ordering\nribbons are supported\n\n-   by size - ribbons are placed in decreasing order of thickness\n    (number of records)\n-   by coding - ribbons are placed in alphanumeric order of the code\n    used to determine their format characteristics through the\n    \\<link\\_coding\\> blocks\n-   by other end - ribbons are placed to limit the number of crossing\n    ribbons, and this order scheme can only be used for one of the two\n    ends\n-   by radius - ribbons are placed in increasing order of the radius of\n    their end\n\nRibbon order is defined in the \\<link\\_order\\> block and specified for\nthe start and end of the ribbon. For example,\n\n    <link_order>\n    start = otherend\n    end   = size\n    </link_order>\n\n### ribbon radius\n\nThe radial position of a ribbon can be adjusted based on any column\nvalue. This is done using \\<radius\\> blocks within the \\<link\\_start\\>\nand \\<link\\_end\\> blocks. The radius of the ribbon is mapped onto radius\nmin-max range (rmin-rmax) based on the value of a column (possibly\nremapped) and a range of acceptable values (min-max).\n\nFor example, the block\n\n    <link_start>\n    ...\n    <radius>\n    use   = yes\n    col   = 7\n    remap = int((190-int(x))/5)\n    min   = 0\n    max   = 10\n    rmin  = 0.7\n    rmax  = 0.98\n    </radius>\n    </link_start>\n\nwill place the start of the ribbon at a radius proportional to a\nremapped height value. The height value is sampled from column 7 and\nremapped according to the remap parameter. The effect of the remap\nparameter as shown here is to map the height values, which range\n144-189, to a range 0-9.\n\nJust like for formatting, radial values are used to split the record\nset. If you have a large number of possible radial values, you will wind\nup with a large number of thin ribbons, since it\\'s likely that no more\nthan a few records will have the same radial value. It is therefore a\ngood idea to bin adjacent radial values together to reduce the number of\nribbons and avoid having a busy, uninterpretable figure.\n\n",
