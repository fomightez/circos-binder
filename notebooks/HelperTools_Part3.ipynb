By merging\\nlinks, you can distill a visually complex representation into one which\\neffectively summarizes the link structure of your data. A bundle is\\nencoded as a new link with a single start and end position, which are\\nformed by the boundaries of the merged links. Bundles are best shown\\nusing the ribbon feature.\\n\\nI will use an example data set to motivate the need for bundlelinks and\\nto show how effective it can be to glean patterns. I will be using the\\nsynteny data that relates the dog and human genomes. This data set has\\nnearly 40,000 links which represent individual syntenic relationships\\nbetween the dog and human genomes (bundlelinks/data/dog.vs.human.txt).\\n\\n### merging adjacent links and the -max\\\\_gap parameter\\n\\nThe [first image](#img1) of this tutorial shows the complexity of an\\nimage that has 40,000 links. There are certain patterns that are obvious\\n(e.g., high similarity beween all of human chrX and dog chrX, as well\\nas, to a lesser extent, human chr14 and dog chr8), but these patterns\\nare visible due to the fact that individual link lines are thick enough\\nfor adjacent links to merge together in the final image. The bundlelinks\\ntool attempts to encode these patterns in a new link data set.\\n\\nI will bundle the dog-vs-human links with progressively looser grouping,\\nto reduce the number of links. First, let\\\\'s try a very strict bundling,\\nwhich merges links that are within 1Mb of one another (-max\\\\_gap\\n1000000). The bundle report for this merging shows that 2,720 bundles\\nwere created. In effect, the number of links has dropped to 7% of its\\noriginal number.\\n\\n```ini\\n# -max_gap 1e6 \\nnum_links 39978\\nnum_links_in_init_bundles 39978\\nnum_init_bundles 2720\\nnum_passed_bundles 2720 (100.00%)\\nnum_links_in_passed_bundles 39978 (100.00%)\\n```\\n\\nThe [second image](#img2) in this tutorial shows these bundles. Note\\nthat these bundles are now drawn as ribbon links since their start and\\nend spans can be large.\\n\\nNote that bundles may overlap at one end - this is a result of the fact\\nthat when links are merged, a given region can give rise to multiple\\nbundles with different end points.\\n\\n### bundling with -strict\\n\\nBy using the -strict setting, any one-link bundles are rejected and\\nabout 200 such bundles are removed.\\n\\n```ini\\n# -strict -max_gap 1e6 \\nnum_links 39978\\nnum_links_in_init_bundles 39788\\nnum_init_bundles 2530\\nnum_passed_bundles 2530 (100.00%)\\nnum_links_in_passed_bundles 39788 (100.00%)\\n```\\n\\n### filtering small bundles\\n\\nThis is still a lot of bundles, however, and the image, though less\\ncomplex than before, is still looking very busy. At this point, you can\\nreduce the number of bundles by either (a) increasing the gap\\\\_size, and\\nthereby merging more distant links together, (b) making the bundle\\nminimum size and membership filter more aggressive, or (c) both.\\n\\nFor example, by adding a minimum size filter using -min\\\\_bundle\\\\_size\\n200000, filters bundles down to 478 ([example](#img3)).\\n\\n```ini\\n# -strict -max_gap 1e6 -min_bundle_size 2e5\\nnum_links 39978\\nnum_links_in_init_bundles 39788\\nnum_init_bundles 2530\\nnum_passed_bundles 478 (18.89%)\\nnum_links_in_passed_bundles 11875 (29.85%)\\n```\\n\\nTightening the filter further, only 13 bundles are passed if the minimum\\nbundle size is 1Mb. In this case, these 13 bundles represent the largest\\nregions of the respective genomes that harboured tightly (within 1Mb)\\nspaced links.\\n\\nIf size of links is less important than the number of links in a bundle,\\nyou can filter bundles based on the number of links they comprise using\\n-min\\\\_bundle\\\\_membership ([example](#img5)).\\n\\n### filtering gappy bundles\\n\\nOn the other hand, by loosening the maximum gap parameter, links which\\nwere previously in different bundles (or unbundled) because their ends\\nwere not sufficiently close to another link, are now brought into the\\nsame bundle. As you grow the gap parameter, bundles become more gappy.\\nThat is, the spatial relationship between bundled links grows weaker\\nbecause more distant links are accepted into the bundle. To avoid\\nexcessively gappy bundles, use -min\\\\_bundle\\\\_identity, which filters\\nbundles based on the size of their links relative to the extent of the\\nbundle.\\n\\nFor example, with a maximum gap of 10Mb and a min\\\\_bundle\\\\_identity of\\n0.25, there are 81 bundles that are passed ([example](#img4)).\\n\\n```ini\\nnum_links 39978\\nnum_links_in_init_bundles 39839\\nnum_init_bundles 524\\nnum_passed_bundles 81 (15.46%)\\nnum_links_in_passed_bundles 2194 (5.51%)\\n```\\n\\n### bundlelinks and orderchr\\n\\nThe bundlelinks script is very useful when you want to use orderchr to\\noptimize chromosome order, but have such a large data set that the\\noptimization takes a very long time.\\n\\nFirst, use bundlelinks to merge links together and then run orderchr on\\nthe bundled data set. By reducing the number of links to 1,000-2,000 the\\norderchr optimization can proceed relatively quickly. After you\\\\'ve\\nrefined the order, you can use the new chromosome arrangement on the\\noriginal, unbundled dataset ([example](#img6)).\\n\\nbundlelinks manpage\\n-------------------\\n\\n-   [NAME](#NAME)\\n-   [SYNOPSIS](#SYNOPSIS)\\n-   [DESCRIPTION](#DESCRIPTION)\\n-   [OUTPUT](#OUTPUT)\\n-   [OPTIONS](#OPTIONS)\\n```ini\\n-   [-max\\\\_gap](#_max_gap)\\n-   [-min\\\\_bundle\\\\_membership,\\n-strict](#_min_bundle_membership_strict)\\n-   [-min\\\\_bundle\\\\_size](#_min_bundle_size)\\n-   [-min\\\\_bundle\\\\_identity](#_min_bundle_identity)\\n```\\n-   [HISTORY](#HISTORY)\\n-   [BUGS](#BUGS)\\n-   [AUTHOR](#AUTHOR)\\n-   [CONTACT](#CONTACT)\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[NAME]{#NAME}\\n=============\\n\\nbundlelinks - bundle neighbouring links together in an effort to reduce\\ncomplexity of link structure\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[SYNOPSIS]{#SYNOPSIS}\\n=====================\\n\\n```ini\\nbundlelinks -links linkfile.txt -max_gap NUM\\n{-min_bundle_membership NUM | -strict }\\n{-min_bundle_size NUM}\\n{-min_bundle_identity FRACTION}\\n```\\n\\n```ini\\nbundlelinks -links data/dog.vs.human.all.txt > data/dog.vs.human.bundles.txt\\n```\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[DESCRIPTION]{#DESCRIPTION}\\n===========================\\n\\nThe purpose of this script is to turn a large set of links into a\\nsmaller one by merging neighbouring links.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[OUTPUT]{#OUTPUT}\\n=================\\n\\nThe script produces a new link file to STDOUT.\\n\\nA tally is sent to STDERR that lists the following\\n\\n```ini\\n# total number of links read in\\nnum_links 39978\\n# number of links in initial bundles (filtered for membership)\\nnum_links_in_init_bundles 39839\\n# total number of initial bundles\\nnum_init_bundles 524\\n# number of accepted bundles (filtered for both size and membership)\\nnum_passed_bundles 277 (52.86%)\\n# number of links in accepted bundles\\nnum_links_in_passed_bundles 36732 (92.20%)\\n```\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[OPTIONS]{#OPTIONS}\\n===================\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[-max\\\\_gap]{#_max_gap}\\n----------------------\\n\\nAdjacent links are merged into bundles if their start/end coordinates\\nare sufficiently close.

Bundling Links](????????????)\n\n\n\nThat page is found as part number 4 of the ??? part ['Helper Tools' section](http://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/quick_start/) of [the larger set of Circos tutorials](http://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/).\n\n\n\nGo back to Part 2 by clicking [here &#8592;](HelperTools_Part2.ipynb).\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n9 --- Helper Tools\n==================\n\n3. Bundling Links\n-----------------\n\n::: {#menu4}\n[[Lesson](/documentation/tutorials/utilities/bundling_links/lesson){.clean}]{.active}\n[Images](/documentation/tutorials/utilities/bundling_links/images){.normal}\n:::\n\nscript location\n---------------\n\n```ini\ntools/bundlelinks\n```\n\nscript usage\n------------\n\n```ini\n> cd tools/bundlelinks\n> ./run\nnum_links 39978\nnum_links_in_init_bundles 39839\nnum_init_bundles 524\nnum_passed_bundles 277 (52.86%)\nnum_links_in_passed_bundles 36732 (92.20%)\n```\n\nThe script sends a new links file to STDOUT and the report shown above\nto STDERR.\n\nTo get the full manpage, use -man.\n\n```ini\n> cd tools/bundlelinks\n> bin/bundlelinks -man\n```\n\nAdjust the configuration file etc/bundlelinks.conf to suit your needs.\n\ndetails\n-------\n\nThe purpose of the bundlelinks tool is to reduce the number of links in\na dataset by merging (or bundling) adjacent links together. By merging\nlinks, you can distill a visually complex representation into one which\neffectively summarizes the link structure of your data. A bundle is\nencoded as a new link with a single start and end position, which are\nformed by the boundaries of the merged links. Bundles are best shown\nusing the ribbon feature.\n\nI will use an example data set to motivate the need for bundlelinks and\nto show how effective it can be to glean patterns. I will be using the\nsynteny data that relates the dog and human genomes. This data set has\nnearly 40,000 links which represent individual syntenic relationships\nbetween the dog and human genomes (bundlelinks/data/dog.vs.human.txt).\n\n### merging adjacent links and the -max\\_gap parameter\n\nThe [first image](#img1) of this tutorial shows the complexity of an\nimage that has 40,000 links. There are certain patterns that are obvious\n(e.g., high similarity beween all of human chrX and dog chrX, as well\nas, to a lesser extent, human chr14 and dog chr8), but these patterns\nare visible due to the fact that individual link lines are thick enough\nfor adjacent links to merge together in the final image. The bundlelinks\ntool attempts to encode these patterns in a new link data set.\n\nI will bundle the dog-vs-human links with progressively looser grouping,\nto reduce the number of links. First, let\\'s try a very strict bundling,\nwhich merges links that are within 1Mb of one another (-max\\_gap\n1000000). The bundle report for this merging shows that 2,720 bundles\nwere created. In effect, the number of links has dropped to 7% of its\noriginal number.\n\n```ini\n# -max_gap 1e6 \nnum_links 39978\nnum_links_in_init_bundles 39978\nnum_init_bundles 2720\nnum_passed_bundles 2720 (100.00%)\nnum_links_in_passed_bundles 39978 (100.00%)\n```\n\nThe [second image](#img2) in this tutorial shows these bundles. Note\nthat these bundles are now drawn as ribbon links since their start and\nend spans can be large.\n\nNote that bundles may overlap at one end - this is a result of the fact\nthat when links are merged, a given region can give rise to multiple\nbundles with different end points.\n\n### bundling with -strict\n\nBy using the -strict setting, any one-link bundles are rejected and\nabout 200 such bundles are removed.\n\n```ini\n# -strict -max_gap 1e6 \nnum_links 39978\nnum_links_in_init_bundles 39788\nnum_init_bundles 2530\nnum_passed_bundles 2530 (100.00%)\nnum_links_in_passed_bundles 39788 (100.00%)\n```\n\n### filtering small bundles\n\nThis is still a lot of bundles, however, and the image, though less\ncomplex than before, is still looking very busy. At this point, you can\nreduce the number of bundles by either (a) increasing the gap\\_size, and\nthereby merging more distant links together, (b) making the bundle\nminimum size and membership filter more aggressive, or (c) both.\n\nFor example, by adding a minimum size filter using -min\\_bundle\\_size\n200000, filters bundles down to 478 ([example](#img3)).\n\n```ini\n# -strict -max_gap 1e6 -min_bundle_size 2e5\nnum_links 39978\nnum_links_in_init_bundles 39788\nnum_init_bundles 2530\nnum_passed_bundles 478 (18.89%)\nnum_links_in_passed_bundles 11875 (29.85%)\n```\n\nTightening the filter further, only 13 bundles are passed if the minimum\nbundle size is 1Mb. In this case, these 13 bundles represent the largest\nregions of the respective genomes that harboured tightly (within 1Mb)\nspaced links.\n\nIf size of links is less important than the number of links in a bundle,\nyou can filter bundles based on the number of links they comprise using\n-min\\_bundle\\_membership ([example](#img5)).\n\n### filtering gappy bundles\n\nOn the other hand, by loosening the maximum gap parameter, links which\nwere previously in different bundles (or unbundled) because their ends\nwere not sufficiently close to another link, are now brought into the\nsame bundle. As you grow the gap parameter, bundles become more gappy.\nThat is, the spatial relationship between bundled links grows weaker\nbecause more distant links are accepted into the bundle. To avoid\nexcessively gappy bundles, use -min\\_bundle\\_identity, which filters\nbundles based on the size of their links relative to the extent of the\nbundle.\n\nFor example, with a maximum gap of 10Mb and a min\\_bundle\\_identity of\n0.25, there are 81 bundles that are passed ([example](#img4)).\n\n```ini\nnum_links 39978\nnum_links_in_init_bundles 39839\nnum_init_bundles 524\nnum_passed_bundles 81 (15.46%)\nnum_links_in_passed_bundles 2194 (5.51%)\n```\n\n### bundlelinks and orderchr\n\nThe bundlelinks script is very useful when you want to use orderchr to\noptimize chromosome order, but have such a large data set that the\noptimization takes a very long time.\n\nFirst, use bundlelinks to merge links together and then run orderchr on\nthe bundled data set. By reducing the number of links to 1,000-2,000 the\norderchr optimization can proceed relatively quickly. After you\\'ve\nrefined the order, you can use the new chromosome arrangement on the\noriginal, unbundled dataset ([example](#img6)).\n\nbundlelinks manpage\n-------------------\n\n-   [NAME](#NAME)\n-   [SYNOPSIS](#SYNOPSIS)\n-   [DESCRIPTION](#DESCRIPTION)\n-   [OUTPUT](#OUTPUT)\n-   [OPTIONS](#OPTIONS)\n```ini\n-   [-max\\_gap](#_max_gap)\n-   [-min\\_bundle\\_membership,\n-strict](#_min_bundle_membership_strict)\n-   [-min\\_bundle\\_size](#_min_bundle_size)\n-   [-min\\_bundle\\_identity](#_min_bundle_identity)\n```\n-   [HISTORY](#HISTORY)\n-   [BUGS](#BUGS)\n-   [AUTHOR](#AUTHOR)\n-   [CONTACT](#CONTACT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[NAME]{#NAME}\n=============\n\nbundlelinks - bundle neighbouring links together in an effort to reduce\ncomplexity of link structure\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[SYNOPSIS]{#SYNOPSIS}\n=====================\n\n```ini\nbundlelinks -links linkfile.txt -max_gap NUM\n{-min_bundle_membership NUM | -strict }\n{-min_bundle_size NUM}\n{-min_bundle_identity FRACTION}\n```\n\n```ini\nbundlelinks -links data/dog.vs.human.all.txt > data/dog.vs.human.bundles.txt\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[DESCRIPTION]{#DESCRIPTION}\n===========================\n\nThe purpose of this script is to turn a large set of links into a\nsmaller one by merging neighbouring links.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[OUTPUT]{#OUTPUT}\n=================\n\nThe script produces a new link file to STDOUT.\n\nA tally is sent to STDERR that lists the following\n\n```ini\n# total number of links read in\nnum_links 39978\n# number of links in initial bundles (filtered for membership)\nnum_links_in_init_bundles 39839\n# total number of initial bundles\nnum_init_bundles 524\n# number of accepted bundles (filtered for both size and membership)\nnum_passed_bundles 277 (52.86%)\n# number of links in accepted bundles\nnum_links_in_passed_bundles 36732 (92.20%)\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[OPTIONS]{#OPTIONS}\n===================\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[-max\\_gap]{#_max_gap}\n----------------------\n\nAdjacent links are merged into bundles if their start/end coordinates\nare sufficiently close.
