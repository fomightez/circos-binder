    "The purpose of the bundlelinks tool is to reduce the number of links in\n",
    "a dataset by merging (or bundling) adjacent links together. By merging\n",
    "links, you can distill a visually complex representation into one which\n",
    "effectively summarizes the link structure of your data. A bundle is\n",
    "encoded as a new link with a single start and end position, which are\n",
    "formed by the boundaries of the merged links. Bundles are best shown\n",
    "using the ribbon feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use an example data set to motivate the need for bundlelinks and\n",
    "to show how effective it can be to glean patterns. I will be using the\n",
    "synteny data that relates the dog and human genomes. This data set has\n",
    "nearly 40,000 links which represent individual syntenic relationships\n",
    "between the dog and human genomes (bundlelinks/data/dog.vs.human.txt).\n",

    "\n",
    "The [first image](#img1) of this tutorial shows the complexity of an\n",
    "image that has 40,000 links. There are certain patterns that are obvious\n",
    "(e.g., high similarity beween all of human chrX and dog chrX, as well\n",
    "as, to a lesser extent, human chr14 and dog chr8), but these patterns\n",
    "are visible due to the fact that individual link lines are thick enough\n",
    "for adjacent links to merge together in the final image. The bundlelinks\n",
    "tool attempts to encode these patterns in a new link data set.\n",

    "I will bundle the dog-vs-human links with progressively looser grouping,\n",

    "which merges links that are within 1Mb of one another (-max\\_gap\n",
    "1000000). The bundle report for this merging shows that 2,720 bundles\n",
