All chromosomes in the input link file are divided into bins\\n(controlled by -bin\\\\_size), and link statistics are calculated on a\\nbin-by-bin basis.\\n\\nFor the purpose of this script that the first line of a link line pair\\nis refered to as the originating position and the second line as the\\ntarget position. Thus the link given by the lines\\n\\n```ini\\nsegdup04822 hs2 131691333 131718278\\nsegdup04822 hs18 14507744 14534120\\n```\\n\\nhas hs2 as the originating chromosome (or start of link) and hs18 as the\\ntarget chromosome (or end of link). For your application, the links may\\nbe bidirectional (such as the segmental duplication used in this\\nexample), but the asymmetry of the start/end position is inherent from\\nthe format of the link data file.\\n\\n### counting link size\\n\\nThe default values in the etc/binlinks.conf file make binlinks count the\\ntotal size of links on the originating chromosomes.\\n\\n```ini\\n> bin/binlinks\\n...\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 1739544.0000\\nhs14 19000000 19999999 816821.0000\\nhs14 20000000 20999999 69080.0000\\n...\\n```\\n\\nFor example, the links that originate in the bin hs14:14:18-19Mb add up\\nto 1.739Mb. It\\\\'s important to realize that this sum is the sum of the\\nstart of the links (each link is composed of two spans - a start span on\\nthe originating chromosome and an end span on the target chromosome).\\n\\nYou can use -link\\\\_end to tabulate the total size of the end spans for a\\nbin.\\n\\n```ini\\n> bin/binlinks -link_end 1\\n...\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 2256283.0000\\nhs14 19000000 19999999 807211.0000\\nhs14 20000000 20999999 78425.0000\\n...\\n```\\n\\nIn this case, the links that originate in the bin hs14:18-19Mb have end\\nspans that total 2.256Mb.\\n\\nYou can add both the start and end spans of the links in a bin using\\n-link\\\\_end 2.\\n\\n```ini\\n> bin/binlinks -link_end 2\\n...\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 3995827.0000\\nhs14 19000000 19999999 1624032.0000\\nhs14 20000000 20999999 147505.0000\\n...\\n```\\n\\nInstead of the link span size, you can add up the number of links in a\\nbin using -num. In this case, each bin that overlaps with the link start\\nand end span will receive a +1 contribution from the link.\\n\\nUse -log to logarithmically scale the bin values.\\n\\n### applying target chromosome color to bin statistic\\n\\nUse -color\\\\_by\\\\_chr to add a color to each bin based on the consensus\\ntarget chromosome (the chromosome receiving the largest contribution\\nfrom the bin).\\n\\n```ini\\n> bin/binlinks -color_by_chr\\n...\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 1739544.0000 fill_color=hs22\\nhs14 19000000 19999999 816821.0000 fill_color=hs22\\nhs14 20000000 20999999 69080.0000 fill_color=hs14\\n...\\n```\\n\\n### obtaining consensus chromosome statistics\\n\\nTypically you will have a large number of links that originate from each\\nbin. Whereas default output style (-output\\\\_style 0) reports the total\\nstatistics for a bin, as described above, if you want to obtain\\nstatistics based on individual chromosomes, use the other output styles\\ndescribed below.\\n\\nFor each bin, statistics for the consensus target chromosome (the\\nchromosome with the largest contribution of links from the bin) is\\nobtained with -output\\\\_style 1. The output is also annotated with the\\ncolor of the consensus chromosome.\\n\\n```ini\\n> bin/binlinks -output_style 1\\n...\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 688034.0000 fill_color=hs22\\nhs14 19000000 19999999 264389.0000 fill_color=hs22\\nhs14 20000000 20999999 65213.0000 fill_color=hs14\\n...\\n```\\n\\nNote the difference between this output and the corresponding output\\nusing -output\\\\_style 0. In the present case, the largest fraction of\\nlinks from hs14:18-19Mb terminate on hs22 and total 688kb.\\n\\nWhereas -output\\\\_style 1 shows you the statistic for all links in the\\nbin and the color of the consensus target chromosome, -output\\\\_style 2\\ngives a value for the bin for each target chromosome.\\n\\n```ini\\n> bin/binlinks -output_style 2\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 688034.0000 fill_color=hs22\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 303434.0000 fill_color=hs14\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 257791.0000 fill_color=hs18\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 235624.0000 fill_color=hs15\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 218463.0000 fill_color=hs21\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 18850.0000 fill_color=hs17\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 17348.0000 fill_color=hs16\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hsx\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hsy\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs1\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs2\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs3\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs4\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs5\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs6\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs7\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs8\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs9\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs10\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs11\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs12\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs13\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs19\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs20\\n```\\n\\nThe advantage of -output\\\\_style 2 is that it can be filtered for a\\nchromosome of interest to determine its contribution to the links.\\n\\n```ini\\n> bin/binlinks -output_style 2 | grep =hs22\\n...\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 688034.0000 fill_color=hs22\\nhs14 19000000 19999999 264389.0000 fill_color=hs22\\nhs14 20000000 20999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs22\\n...\\n```\\n\\n### creating stacked histograms\\n\\nFinally, -output\\\\_style 3 generates track data for stacked histograms.\\n\\n```ini\\n> bin/binlinks -output_style 3\\nfill_color=hsx,hsy,hs1,hs2,hs3,hs4,hs5,hs6,hs7,hs8,hs9,hs10,hs11,hs12,hs13,hs14,hs15,hs16,hs17,hs18,hs19,hs20,hs21,hs22\\n...\\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,\\n0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,\\n0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,303434.0000,235624.0000,\\n17348.0000,18850.0000,257791.0000,0.0000,0.0000,\\n218463.0000,688034.0000\\n...\\n```\\n\\nThe data is written to STDOUT and the color list to STDERR, so you\\nshould redirect them appropriately.\\n\\n```ini\\n# redirect histogram values to a file and send STDERR to terminal - cut and paste \\n# the color values into the histogram  block\\n> bin/binlinks -output_style 3 > data.txt \\n```\\n\\nThe colors will be named after the target chromosomes. I typically use\\nhsNNN for human chromosomes (to distinguish them from chromosomes of\\nother species such as mouse (mmNNN), rat (rnNNN), and so on). However,\\nchromosome colors are encoded with names chr1, chr2, chr3, and so on.\\nYou\\\\'ll need to either change (or add) color definitions in\\netc/colors.conf in the Circos distribution or rename the colors from\\nCHRPREFIXNNN to chrNNN.\\n\\n\"\n",

Generate Link Density Tracks\n-------------------------------\n\n::: {#menu4}\n[[Lesson](/documentation/tutorials/utilities/density_tracks/lesson){.clean}]{.active}\n[Images](/documentation/tutorials/utilities/density_tracks/images){.normal}\n:::\n\nscript location\n---------------\n\n```ini\ntools/binlinks\n```\n\nscript usage\n------------\n\n```ini\n> cd tools/binlinks\n# bin a link file by size of links on originating chromosome\n> bin/binlinks -links data/segdup.links.txt > data/histogram.txt\n# bin a link file by size of links on target chromosome\n> bin/binlinks -links data/segdup.links.txt -link_end 1 > data/histogram.txt\n# bin a link file by number of links on originating chromosomes\n> bin/binlinks -num -links data/segdup.links.txt > data/histogram.txt\n# color bin values by target chromosome\n> bin/binlinks -num -links data/segdup.links.txt -output_style 1 > data/histogram.txt\n# create stacked histogram data\n> bin/binlinks -num -links data/segdup.links.txt -output_style 3 > data/histogram.txt\n```\n\nAny values in the configuration file etc/binlinks.conf are overwritten\nwith command-line parameters of the same name.\n\ndetails\n-------\n\nThe purpose of this script is to generate data for histogram and\nhighlight tracks that stores the number, size and consensus position of\nlinks. All chromosomes in the input link file are divided into bins\n(controlled by -bin\\_size), and link statistics are calculated on a\nbin-by-bin basis.\n\nFor the purpose of this script that the first line of a link line pair\nis refered to as the originating position and the second line as the\ntarget position. Thus the link given by the lines\n\n```ini\nsegdup04822 hs2 131691333 131718278\nsegdup04822 hs18 14507744 14534120\n```\n\nhas hs2 as the originating chromosome (or start of link) and hs18 as the\ntarget chromosome (or end of link). For your application, the links may\nbe bidirectional (such as the segmental duplication used in this\nexample), but the asymmetry of the start/end position is inherent from\nthe format of the link data file.\n\n### counting link size\n\nThe default values in the etc/binlinks.conf file make binlinks count the\ntotal size of links on the originating chromosomes.\n\n```ini\n> bin/binlinks\n...\nhs14 18000000 18999999 1739544.0000\nhs14 19000000 19999999 816821.0000\nhs14 20000000 20999999 69080.0000\n...\n```\n\nFor example, the links that originate in the bin hs14:14:18-19Mb add up\nto 1.739Mb. It\\'s important to realize that this sum is the sum of the\nstart of the links (each link is composed of two spans - a start span on\nthe originating chromosome and an end span on the target chromosome).\n\nYou can use -link\\_end to tabulate the total size of the end spans for a\nbin.\n\n```ini\n> bin/binlinks -link_end 1\n...\nhs14 18000000 18999999 2256283.0000\nhs14 19000000 19999999 807211.0000\nhs14 20000000 20999999 78425.0000\n...\n```\n\nIn this case, the links that originate in the bin hs14:18-19Mb have end\nspans that total 2.256Mb.\n\nYou can add both the start and end spans of the links in a bin using\n-link\\_end 2.\n\n```ini\n> bin/binlinks -link_end 2\n...\nhs14 18000000 18999999 3995827.0000\nhs14 19000000 19999999 1624032.0000\nhs14 20000000 20999999 147505.0000\n...\n```\n\nInstead of the link span size, you can add up the number of links in a\nbin using -num. In this case, each bin that overlaps with the link start\nand end span will receive a +1 contribution from the link.\n\nUse -log to logarithmically scale the bin values.\n\n### applying target chromosome color to bin statistic\n\nUse -color\\_by\\_chr to add a color to each bin based on the consensus\ntarget chromosome (the chromosome receiving the largest contribution\nfrom the bin).\n\n```ini\n> bin/binlinks -color_by_chr\n...\nhs14 18000000 18999999 1739544.0000 fill_color=hs22\nhs14 19000000 19999999 816821.0000 fill_color=hs22\nhs14 20000000 20999999 69080.0000 fill_color=hs14\n...\n```\n\n### obtaining consensus chromosome statistics\n\nTypically you will have a large number of links that originate from each\nbin. Whereas default output style (-output\\_style 0) reports the total\nstatistics for a bin, as described above, if you want to obtain\nstatistics based on individual chromosomes, use the other output styles\ndescribed below.\n\nFor each bin, statistics for the consensus target chromosome (the\nchromosome with the largest contribution of links from the bin) is\nobtained with -output\\_style 1. The output is also annotated with the\ncolor of the consensus chromosome.\n\n```ini\n> bin/binlinks -output_style 1\n...\nhs14 18000000 18999999 688034.0000 fill_color=hs22\nhs14 19000000 19999999 264389.0000 fill_color=hs22\nhs14 20000000 20999999 65213.0000 fill_color=hs14\n...\n```\n\nNote the difference between this output and the corresponding output\nusing -output\\_style 0. In the present case, the largest fraction of\nlinks from hs14:18-19Mb terminate on hs22 and total 688kb.\n\nWhereas -output\\_style 1 shows you the statistic for all links in the\nbin and the color of the consensus target chromosome, -output\\_style 2\ngives a value for the bin for each target chromosome.\n\n```ini\n> bin/binlinks -output_style 2\nhs14 18000000 18999999 688034.0000 fill_color=hs22\nhs14 18000000 18999999 303434.0000 fill_color=hs14\nhs14 18000000 18999999 257791.0000 fill_color=hs18\nhs14 18000000 18999999 235624.0000 fill_color=hs15\nhs14 18000000 18999999 218463.0000 fill_color=hs21\nhs14 18000000 18999999 18850.0000 fill_color=hs17\nhs14 18000000 18999999 17348.0000 fill_color=hs16\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hsx\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hsy\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs1\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs2\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs3\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs4\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs5\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs6\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs7\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs8\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs9\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs10\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs11\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs12\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs13\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs19\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs20\n```\n\nThe advantage of -output\\_style 2 is that it can be filtered for a\nchromosome of interest to determine its contribution to the links.\n\n```ini\n> bin/binlinks -output_style 2 | grep =hs22\n...\nhs14 18000000 18999999 688034.0000 fill_color=hs22\nhs14 19000000 19999999 264389.0000 fill_color=hs22\nhs14 20000000 20999999 0.0000 fill_color=hs22\n...\n```\n\n### creating stacked histograms\n\nFinally, -output\\_style 3 generates track data for stacked histograms.\n\n```ini\n> bin/binlinks -output_style 3\nfill_color=hsx,hsy,hs1,hs2,hs3,hs4,hs5,hs6,hs7,hs8,hs9,hs10,hs11,hs12,hs13,hs14,hs15,hs16,hs17,hs18,hs19,hs20,hs21,hs22\n...\nhs14 18000000 18999999 0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,\n0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,\n0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,303434.0000,235624.0000,\n17348.0000,18850.0000,257791.0000,0.0000,0.0000,\n218463.0000,688034.0000\n...\n```\n\nThe data is written to STDOUT and the color list to STDERR, so you\nshould redirect them appropriately.\n\n```ini\n# redirect histogram values to a file and send STDERR to terminal - cut and paste \n# the color values into the histogram  block\n> bin/binlinks -output_style 3 > data.txt \n```\n\nThe colors will be named after the target chromosomes. I typically use\nhsNNN for human chromosomes (to distinguish them from chromosomes of\nother species such as mouse (mmNNN), rat (rnNNN), and so on). However,\nchromosome colors are encoded with names chr1, chr2, chr3, and so on.\nYou\\'ll need to either change (or add) color definitions in\netc/colors.conf in the Circos distribution or rename the colors from\nCHRPREFIXNNN to chrNNN.\n\n",
